I am interested in all aspects of large language models (LLMs), ranging from: 
- pretraining dynamics (e.g. [hyperparameter transfer for weight decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13698) and [function-space learning rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17405))
- efficiency
- understanding them using mechanistic interpretability (e.g. [random baselines for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18147), [residual stream analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04185) and [Jacobian Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18147))
- development of self-improving LLM agents

I am currently a Lecturer (US Assistant Professor) at the University of Bristol.
While my current research focuses on LLMs, my previous work ranges across probabilistic and Bayesian machine learning, along with computational neuroscience (PhD at Gatsby Unit, UCL).
